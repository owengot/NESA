  "body": "A new type of cervical dilator, the Aqueduct was examined clinically through the NESA. This is a device which dilates the cervical canal in a radial way within minutes and enables any kind of diagnostic or operative procedure. The device seems to be non - invasive and works similar to Laminaria, but within a very short time. The NESA initiated prospective studies in different affiliated departments."
