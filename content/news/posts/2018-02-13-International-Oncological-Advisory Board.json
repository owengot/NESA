  "body": "For any diagnosed oncological condition, there are various ways of suggested treatment. In order to improve the post-surgical outcome, NESA initiated an International Oncological Advisory Board with opinion leaders in oncological surgery, oncologists and basic scientists from different continents in order to enable dialogue between different specialties and to ensure optimal treatment, specified for the individual patient, based on evidence know-how. The Board serves also as a platform for exchange of knowledge and ideas. \n\n In order to improve the outcome of oncological patients, the NESA, together with MediHelp and MediSky, launched a forum of opinion - leaders in surgery and oncology to provide second opinion to cancer patients, as well as navigation to the most optimal sites. It will allow cancer patients to get the most advanced mode of treatment based on evidence. \n\n **NESACard** The NESA, in collaboration with MediHelp, launched the NESACard. NESACard holders are supporting NESAâ€™s activities in countries with limited resources, are entitled for second opinion in case of oncological disease and belong to a support - family for NESA activities."
