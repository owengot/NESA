Participants from 31 countries came to the **Harbiye Askeri Museum** in the centre of the Turkish metropolis to update their knowledge in basic sciences as well as in their own professions and to be exposed to new ideas and techniques in other disciplines. Thanks to the excellent lectures given by experts in fields such as general surgery, gynaecology and obstetrics, otolaryngology, anaesthesiology and urology, the conference reached a high scientific standard. \n Among the highlights of the conference were the introduction of new surgical methods such as **neuropelveology**, which was presented by Prof. Marc Possover, and **Natural Orifice Surgery**, introduced by the NESA.",
